#### Nature Of Code Examples implemented using Openframeworks

This repository holds some examples from Daniel Shiffmans excellent book [The Nature Of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) reimplemented using [Openframeworks](openframeworks.cc) (basically the [ofnode](https://github.com/ofnode) fork).


### ofnode

[ofnode](https://github.com/ofnode) is an Openframeworks fork and provides several improvements for the ofx build system.
